# SimonsGame
Simon’s Game is a classic electronic memory game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds. Test your memory and focus as you follow Simon’s pattern—one mistake, and it’s game over!

**How to Play Simon's Game:**

Objective:
Follow the pattern of lights and sounds as Simon tests your memory. Repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level.

Getting Started:
Simon will light up one of the colored buttons (Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow) and play a sound.
Your task is to press the button that lit up.

Progressing the Game:
After you repeat the sequence correctly, Simon will add another light to the pattern.
Memorize and repeat the entire sequence in the correct order.

Game Over:
If you press the wrong button or break the sequence, the game ends.
Try to beat your high score and improve your memory skills!

Tips:
Pay attention to the lights and sounds.
Stay focused as the sequences get longer and faster.
